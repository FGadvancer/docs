# Docker Deployment for OpenIM


## üåç Environment Preparation

- Install Docker with the Compose plugin or docker-compose on your server. For installation details, visit the [Docker Compose Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/).

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Cloning

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-docker
```

## üîß Configuration Modification

- Modify the `.env` file to set up the external IP. If using a domain name, [Nginx](./nginxDomainConfig.mdx) configuration is required.

  ```plaintext
  # Set the external access address for MinIO service (external IP or domain)
  MINIO_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS="http://external_ip:10005" 
  ```

- Please refer to the comments in the .env file for other configurations.

## üöÄ Service Launch

- To start the service:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- To stop the service:

```bash
docker compose down
```

- To view logs:

```bash
docker logs -f openim-server
docker logs -f openim-chat
```

## Below are the deployment processes for versions release-v3.6 and earlier:

---

# üõ† Docker Deployment

## 1. Environment and Component Requirements
For server environment, system, and storage components, refer to [this document](./env-comp).

---

## 2. Docker Deployment

## 2.1 Clone Repository and Initialize

```jsx
git clone https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-docker openim-docker && cd openim-docker && make init
```

üí° **Tips**
> If you obtained **openim-docker** not by cloning but by downloading a zip file, run the command **find ./ -name "*.sh" | xargs chmod +x** to grant script execution permissions.

---

## 2.2 Set OPENIM_IP

üîî **You must set OPENIM_IP, and it cannot be 127.0.0.1**

```jsx
# If the server has an external IP
export OPENIM_IP="external IP"

# If only providing internal network service
export OPENIM_IP="internal IP"
```

## 2.3 Start Service and View Logs

```jsx
docker compose up -d
docker ps
docker compose logs -f openim-chat
docker compose logs -f openim-server
```

## 5. About Configuration Modification

This project has complex configuration items, primarily because some settings involve **`.env`**, **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`**, and **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`** multiple files. The explanation for modifying configuration items is divided into two parts: shared configuration items and other configuration items.

### 5.1 Shared Configuration Items

Shared configuration items across **`.env`**, **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`**, and **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`**:

1. MySQL/Mongo/Redis/Kafka/Zookeeper/MinIO ports and passwords;
2. SECRET;
3. API_OPENIM_PORT;
4. OPENIM_IP;
5. MINIO_PORT;
6. GRAFANA_PORT

### 5.2 Modification Methods

For modifying shared configuration items, choose one of the following methods:

Method One: Regenerate all configurations

If a comprehensive update of configurations is needed, follow these steps:

1. Delete existing configuration files: Remove **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`** and **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`** files.
2. Modify the `.env` file: Update relevant settings in the **`.env`** file.
3. Regenerate configurations and restart service: Execute **`docker compose down ; docker compose up -d`**, which will regenerate configuration files based on the new settings in the **`.env`** file and restart the service.

Method Two: Modify multiple configuration files separately

If only a partial update is needed, follow these steps:

1. Modify the `.env` file: Update relevant settings in the **`.env`** file.
2. Manually update configuration files: According to modifications in the **`.env`** file, update corresponding settings in **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`** and **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`** files

.
3. Special variable additional handling: If you modified **`OPENIM_IP`**, **`API_OPENIM_PORT`**, **`MINIO_PORT`**, **`GRAFANA_PORT`**, then you need to update the following configuration items in **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`**:

    ```yaml
    object:
      apiURL: "http://$OPENIM_IP:$API_OPENIM_PORT"
      minio:
        endpoint: "http://$DOCKER_BRIDGE_GATEWAY:$MINIO_PORT"
        signEndpoint: "http://$OPENIM_IP:$MINIO_PORT"
    
    grafanaUrl: http://$OPENIM_IP:$GRAFANA_PORT
    ```
    
4. Restart the service: Execute **`docker compose down ; docker compose up -d`** to apply changes and restart the service.

### 5.3 Other Configuration Item Modification

For non-shared variables in **`.env`**, **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`**, and **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`**, you can individually modify these configuration items in the respective files. Execute **`docker compose down ; docker compose up -d`** to apply changes and restart the service.

## ‚ùì 6. Common Issues

### 6.1 Text messages are sent normally, but sending pictures fails üòï

This may be because the `OPENIM_IP` environment variable was not set before executing the `docker compose up -d` command. You can confirm this by checking the startup logs or by using the following command to search for "127.0.0.1" in the logs:

```bash
grep "127.0.0.1" openim-server/_output/logs/openim-docker.log
```

#### Solution:

1. Set the `OPENIM_IP` environment variable to your public IP address, or to your internal IP address if only providing internal network service:

   ```bash
   export OPENIM_IP="<Public-IP>"
   ```

2. Use the `sed` command to update the `apiURL` and `signEndpoint` configuration items in the `config.yaml` file, changing the address to use the `OPENIM_IP` environment variable specified IP address:

   ```bash
   sed -i -e "s/apiURL: \"http:\/\/127\.0\.0\.1/apiURL: \"http:\/\/${OPENIM_IP}/" \
          -e "s/signEndpoint: \"http:\/\/127\.0\.0\.1/signEndpoint: \"http:\/\/${OPENIM_IP}/" \
          openim-server/config/config.yaml
   ```

After making these configuration changes and restarting the service, you should be able to send picture messages normally.

### 6.2 About Docker Versions üêã

It is strongly recommended to use the `docker compose` command instead of `docker-compose`, as older versions of Docker may not support the gateway feature‚ùå. We advise upgrading to a newer version, such as `23.0.1`üîù.

### 6.3 Viewing Logs üìú

Log locations:

- Runtime logs: `{openim-server, openim-chat}/_output/logs/openim-all.*`
- Startup logs: `{openim-server, openim-chat}/_output/logs/openim-docker.log`
