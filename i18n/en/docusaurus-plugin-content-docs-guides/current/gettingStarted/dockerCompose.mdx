# Docker Deployment for OpenIM

> **Documentation Resources**

+ [Official Deployment Guide](https://docs.openim.io/guides/gettingstarted/dockercompose)

## 🌍 Environment Preparation

- Install Docker with the Compose plugin or docker-compose on your server. For installation details, visit the [Docker Compose Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/).

## 🗂️ Repository Cloning

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-docker
```

## 🔧 Configuration Modification

- Modify the `.env` file to set up the external IP. If using a domain name, Nginx configuration is required.

  ```plaintext
  # Set the external access address for MinIO service (IP or domain)
  MINIO_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS="http://external_ip:10005" 
  ```

- Please refer to the comments in the .env file for other configurations.

## 🚀 Service Launch

- To start the service:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- To stop the service:

```bash
docker compose down
```

- To view logs:

```bash
docker logs -f openim-server
docker logs -f openim-chat
```

## Below are the deployment processes for versions release-v3.6 and earlier:

---

# 🛠 Docker Deployment

## 1. Environment and Component Requirements
For server environment, system, and storage components, refer to [this document](./env-comp).

---

## 2. Docker Deployment

## 2.1 Clone Repository and Initialize

```jsx
git clone https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-docker openim-docker && cd openim-docker && make init
```

💡 **Tips**
> If you obtained **openim-docker** not by cloning but by downloading a zip file, run the command **find ./ -name "*.sh" | xargs chmod +x** to grant script execution permissions.

---

## 2.2 Set OPENIM_IP

🔔 **You must set OPENIM_IP, and it cannot be 127.0.0.1**

```jsx
# If the server has an external IP
export OPENIM_IP="external IP"

# If only providing internal network service
export OPENIM_IP="internal IP"
```

## 2.3 Start Service and View Logs

```jsx
docker compose up -d
docker ps
docker compose logs -f openim-chat
docker compose logs -f openim-server
```

## 5. About Configuration Modification

This project has complex configuration items, primarily because some settings involve **`.env`**, **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`**, and **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`** multiple files. The explanation for modifying configuration items is divided into two parts: shared configuration items and other configuration items.

### 5.1 Shared Configuration Items

Shared configuration items across **`.env`**, **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`**, and **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`**:

1. MySQL/Mongo/Redis/Kafka/Zookeeper/MinIO ports and passwords;
2. SECRET;
3. API_OPENIM_PORT;
4. OPENIM_IP;
5. MINIO_PORT;
6. GRAFANA_PORT

### 5.2 Modification Methods

For modifying shared configuration items, choose one of the following methods:

Method One: Regenerate all configurations

If a comprehensive update of configurations is needed, follow these steps:

1. Delete existing configuration files: Remove **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`** and **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`** files.
2. Modify the `.env` file: Update relevant settings in the **`.env`** file.
3. Regenerate configurations and restart service: Execute **`docker compose down ; docker compose up -d`**, which will regenerate configuration files based on the new settings in the **`.env`** file and restart the service.

Method Two: Modify multiple configuration files separately

If only a partial update is needed, follow these steps:

1. Modify the `.env` file: Update relevant settings in the **`.env`** file.
2. Manually update configuration files: According to modifications in the **`.env`** file, update corresponding settings in **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`** and **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`** files
