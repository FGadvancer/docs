# üõ† Docker Deployment

## 1. Environment and Component Requirements
For server environment, system, and storage components, refer to [this document](./env-comp)

## 2. Docker Deployment

### 2.1 Clone the Repository and Initialize

```jsx
git clone https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-docker openim-docker && cd openim-docker && make init
```
üí° **Tips**
> If you didn't clone directly on your machine, but instead downloaded the **openim-docker** as a compressed package, run the command **find ./ -name "*.sh" | xargs chmod +x** to grant execution permissions to the scripts.


## 2.2 Setting OPENIM_IP

üîî **It is mandatory to set OPENIM_IP, and it cannot be 127.0.0.1**

```jsx
# If the server has a public IP
export OPENIM_IP="Public IP"

# If only providing internal network service
export OPENIM_IP="Internal IP"
```


### 2.3 Start Services and View Logs

```jsx
docker compose up -d
docker ps
docker compose logs -f openim-chat
docker compose logs -f openim-server
```

## 3. Quick Verification

Please refer to the [Quick Verification](./quickTestServer) document.

## 5. About Modifying Configuration Items

This project's configuration items are quite complex, primarily because some configurations involve multiple files such as **`.env`**, **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`**, and **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`**. The modification instructions are divided into two parts: shared configuration items and other configuration items.

### 5.1 Shared Configuration Items

Shared configuration items for **`.env`**, **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`**, and **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`**:

1. mysql/mongo/redis/kafka/zookeeper/minio ports and passwords;
2. SECRET;
3. API_OPENIM_PORT;
4. OPENIM_IP;
5. MINIO_PORT;
6. GRAFANA_PORT.

### 5.2 Modification Methods

For modifying shared configuration items in section 5.1, choose one of the two methods below.

Method One: Regenerate All Configurations

If a comprehensive update of configurations is needed, follow these steps:

1. Delete existing configuration files: delete **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`** and **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`** files.
2. Modify `.env` file: update the related configuration items in the **`.env`** file.
3. Regenerate configurations and restart services: execute **`docker compose down ; docker compose up -d`**. This will regenerate configuration files based on new settings in the **`.env`** file and restart the services.

Method Two: Modify Multiple Configuration Files Separately

If only partial updates are needed, follow these steps:

1. Modify `.env` file: update the related configuration items in the **`.env`** file.
2. Manually update configuration files: according to the changes in the **`.env`** file, correspondingly update the configuration items in **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`** and **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`**.
3. Special handling for specific variables: if **`OPENIM_IP`**, **`API_OPENIM_PORT`**, **`MINIO_PORT`**, **`GRAFANA_PORT`** are modified, update the following configuration items in **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`**:

    ```yaml
    object:
      apiURL: "http://$OPENIM_IP:$API_OPENIM_PORT"
      minio:
        endpoint: "http://$DOCKER_BRIDGE_GATEWAY:$MINIO_PORT"
        signEndpoint: "http://$OPENIM_IP:$MINIO_PORT"
    
    grafanaUrl: http://$OPENIM_IP:$GRAFANA_PORT
    ```
    
4. Restart services: execute **`docker compose down ; docker compose up -d`** to apply changes and restart services.

### 5.3 Modifying Other Configuration Items

For non-shared variables in **`.env`**, **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`**, and **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`**, these configuration items can be modified individually in the respective files. Execute **`docker compose down ; docker compose up -d`** to apply changes and restart services.

## ‚ùì 6. Common Issues

### 6.1 Can send text messages normally, but sending images fails üòï

This issue might occur if the `OPENIM_IP` environment variable was not set before executing the `docker compose up -d` command. You can confirm this by checking the startup logs or using the following command to search for the "127.0.0.1" address in the logs:

```bash
grep "127.0.0.1" openim-server/_output/logs/openim-docker.log
```

#### Solution:

1. Set the `OPENIM_IP` environment variable to your public IP address, or to your internal IP address if you are providing services within a LAN:

   ```bash
   export OPENIM_IP="<Public-IP>"
   ```

2. Use the `sed` command to update the `apiURL` and `signEndpoint` configuration items in the `config.yaml` file, changing the address to use the `OPENIM_IP` environment variable specified IP address:

   ```bash
   sed -i -e "s/apiURL: \"http:\/\/127\.0\.0\.1/apiURL: \"http:\/\/${OPENIM_IP}/" \
          -e "s/signEndpoint: \"http:\/\/127\.0\.0\.1/signEndpoint: \"http:\/\/${OPENIM_IP}/" \
          openim-server/config/config.yaml
   ```

After modifying the configuration and restarting the service with the above steps, sending images should work normally.

### 6.3. Regarding Docker Version üêã
It is strongly recommended to use the docker compose command instead of docker-compose, as older Docker versions might not support the gateway feature‚ùå. We advise upgrading to a newer version, such as `23.0.1`üîù.


### 6.2 üìú Viewing Logs

Log locations:

- Runtime logs: `{openim-server, openim-chat}/_output/logs/openim-all.*`
- Startup logs: `{openim-server, openim-chat}/_output/logs/openim-docker.log`
