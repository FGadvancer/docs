# 📞 Callback Description

📢 **OpenIM** offers a robust callback functionality. When a specific event occurs, either before or after it happens, **OpenIM Server** proactively notifies the APP's business server via HTTP/HTTPS requests. This way, the APP's business server can intervene in the subsequent process of the event or synchronize data based on these callbacks.

## 📑 Callback Categories

Based on the timing of processing, callbacks are divided into two main categories:

- 🚫 **Callbacks before the event is sent**: This type of callback (before type) aims to let the APP's business server intervene in event processing, such as filtering sensitive words in a message. **OpenIM Server** will determine the subsequent process based on the callback's return.

- 📤 **Notifications after the event is sent**: This type of callback (after type) is primarily used to notify the APP's business server to synchronize data, for example, when a user joins a group. At this point, **OpenIM Server** will ignore the callback's return and error codes.

## ⚙️ Configuration Description

```yaml
callback:
  url:
  beforeCreateGroup:
    enable: false
    timeout: 5
    failedContinue: true
```

- url: Callback address of the APP's business server, supporting HTTP/HTTPS
- enable: Whether to enable this callback
- timeout: Response timeout duration (in seconds)
- failedContinue: Whether to continue the process after timeout or API failure, generally effective only for the "before" type of callback.

## 🔄 Callback Protocol

**OpenIM Server** utilizes third-party callback mechanisms based on the **HTTP/HTTPS** protocol. When initiating a callback request, **OpenIM Server** uses the **POST** request method to notify the APP's business server. The specific content of these requests will be directly included in the request body.
